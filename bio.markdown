## Bio

I am a recent graduate of California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo,
where I received a Bachelors degree in
Computer Science. My interests include programming languages, static analysis, compilation, functional programming,
and natural language processing. For my senior project I created
[a racket library offering cross-platform bindings to OpenFST](https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/openfst),
which I still maintain.

I work as a compiler engineer at NVIDIA on the team responsible for NVVM.
I've previously interned for Dropbox and Rosepoint Navigation Systems. Outside of work
I enjoy hiking, backpacking, swimming, and cycling.

I have not updated this website since the summer of 2022
