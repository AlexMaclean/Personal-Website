      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        I am a recent graduate of California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, where I received a Bachelors degree in
        Computer Science. My interests include programming languages, static analysis, compilation, functional programming,
        and natural language processing. For my senior project I created
        <a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/openfst">a racket library offering cross-platform bindings to OpenFST</a>, which
        I still maintain.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work as a compiler engineer at NVIDIA on the team responsible for NVVM.
        I've previously interned for Dropbox and Rosepoint Navigation Systems. Outside of work
        I enjoy hiking, backpacking, swimming, and cycling.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have not updated this website since the summer of 2022
