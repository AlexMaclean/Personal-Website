      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently a student at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, where I am
        majoring in Computer Science. I was born and grew up in Seattle,
        Washington, where I attended Roosevelt High School and earned Eagle
        Scout in Troop 186. My interests include swimming, climbing, and
        software development.

        I interned virtually for Dropbox in the summers of 2021 and 2020 on the
        team success and photos teams. Previous to that, I interned at Rosepoint
        Navigation Systems in 2019. In high school, I interned for Math
