        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently a student at Cal Poly in San Luis Obispo, where I am
          majoring in Computer Science. I was born and grew up in Seattle,
          Washington, where I attended Roosevelt High School and earned Eagle
          Scout in Troop 186. My interests include swimming, climbing, and
          software development.
        </p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <p>
          I interned virtually for Dropbox in the summers of 2021 and 2020 on
          the team success and photos teams. Previous to that, I interned at
          Rosepoint Navigation Systems in 2019. In high school, I interned for
          Math Adventure, Microsoft, and The MacCoss Lab.
