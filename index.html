      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently pursing a Bachelors degree at California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, where I am
        majoring in Computer Science. My interests include programming languages, static analysis, compilation, functional programming,
        and natural language processing.
         I was born and grew up in Seattle,
        Washington, where I attended Roosevelt High School and earned Eagle
        Scout in Troop 186. Outside of school I enjoy hiking, backpacking, swimming, and cycling.
      </p>

      <p>
        I interned virtually for Dropbox in the summers of 2021 and 2020 on the
        team success and photos teams. Previous to that, I interned at Rosepoint
        Navigation Systems in 2019. In high school, I interned for Math
        Adventure, Microsoft, and The MacCoss Lab.
