      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>
        I am a recent graduate of California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, where I recived a Bachelors degree in
        Computer Science. My interests include programming languages, static analysis, compilation, functional programming,
        and natural language processing. For my senior project I created
        <a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/openfst">a racket library offering cross-platform bindings to OpenFST</a>, which
        I still maintain.
         I was born and grew up in Seattle,
        Washington, where I attended Roosevelt High School and earned Eagle
        Scout in Troop 186. Outside of school I enjoy hiking, backpacking, swimming, and cycling.

        I interned virtually for Dropbox in the summers of 2021 and 2020 on the
        team success and photos teams. Previous to that, I interned at Rosepoint
        Navigation Systems in 2019. In high school, I interned for Math
        Adventure, Microsoft, and The MacCoss Lab.
