<p>
    I am a recent graduate of California Polytechnic State University in San Luis Obispo, where I received a Bachelors
    degree in
    Computer Science. My interests include programming languages, static analysis, compilation, functional programming,
    and natural language processing. For my senior project I created
    <a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/openfst">a racket library offering cross-platform bindings to
        OpenFST</a>, which
    I still maintain.

    I work as a compiler engineer at NVIDIA on the team responsible for NVVM.
    I've previously interned for Dropbox and Rosepoint Navigation Systems. Outside of work
    I enjoy hiking, backpacking, swimming, and cycling.
